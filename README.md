# JavaGraph
*Network simulation using Graphs in Java.*

---
### Summary

3<sup>rd</sup> year project at the Polytech Nancy's Engineering School.
The main goal was to realise a network simulation (DHCP server, routing table)
using the Java language and graph theory.

### Features

###### TBA:
* DHCP Server
* BFS Algorithm
* DFS Algorithm
* IP class
* Machine class (IP, logs, auth with ENUM) extending Sommet
* Global main class for performance testing
* Routing
* GEXF export files
* Display using GEXF and sigma.js
###### Working:
* Graph using adjacency matrices
* Graph using Node class
* Shortest paths between nodes algorithms
